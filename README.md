# Intro
This README serves as a set of guidelines for how to use Piazza (or other forums) in a considerate way. It will leverage policies from various university courses, and my personal experience as a student at Cornell University and Georgia Tech, as well as my experience as a TA for numerous Computer Science courses.

1. **Do not share assignment or exam code, answers, or hints.** Unless explicitly allowed or approved by teaching staff, this could be an honor code violation and get you in serious trouble.
    1. **Make posts private when you need to include this stuff, or personal details.** Somewhat self explanatory - you are not breaking honor code by sharing this information with staff, and you probably want to keep personal details (such as a medical-based extension request) limited to those who need to know.
1. **Respond to questions.**  Even assuming a large enough TA team that they could answer every question, the TAs cannot, and would not be able to, respond to every question in a timely manner. Online courses with students and TAs distributed across timezones makes this an even bigger problem. Help them out, and answer questions if you know the answer!
1. **Do not remove questions.** This may sound obvious, but it's not uncommon for some students to delete their questions once they get an answer. This may seem OK to some, but it basically ends up wasting TA/student time to create a response that will only help one student, and defeats the purpose of a public forum like Piazza.
1. **If you figure out a solution, share it!** This one is basically a meme across the internet (particularly for StackOverflow type websites) - so many questions can end up looking like "How do you reverse entropy? edit: solved!", which causes anyone with the same problem to be left struggling, when you've already figured out the answer.
1. **Use megathreads where applicable.** If the teaching staff has created a megathread for an assignment, lecture topic, etc, use them! This helps keep Piazza uncluttered, making it easier for TAs to keep track of what questions they need to answer.
1. **Make posts public when possible.** Unless your post has a question that requires you to share personal details or assignment or exam code, answers, or hints, make your post public. If you have the problem, chances are other students will too, and it will save the TAs time to be able to answer the question only once.
1. **Be respectful. Act like your boss is going to read your posts.** It should really go without saying, but Piazza is not an anonymous, online platform for trolling. If you threaten, denigrate, or are generally rude/disrespectful to your classmates or teaching staff, you are likely breaking your school's honor code and could face disciplinary action.

# Piazza Specific Notes
1. **Do not use the "Student Answer" to respond unless you are at least 90% certain that you can write a clear, accurate answer to the question**. Followups are a great altnerative, and can allow you to contribute "best guesses" without marking the question as answered (which will often result in the TAs overlooking the question in favor of other questions).
1. **Use tags on posts where applicable.** See above! If the tags are there, use them! It will help you, other students, and TAs find relevant posts.
